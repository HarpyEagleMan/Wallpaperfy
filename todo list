Installation currently only works on linux
    * need to find out how and where and how to install stuff on windows, what is the folder for the script to run
    from command line
    * shabang to alow wallpaperfy to be lanched without calling python first does not work the same on linux and windows
    need to find a way around that.
    * find out what folder and how to install on macos

Running wallpaperfy
    * need someone to test it on macos as i dont have apple stuff
    * need someone to test in other desktop enviroment in linux. other than the one i tested. i3, i know
    diferent DE use diferent ways of setting wallpapers
    * also all other oses may need its way of setting wallpaper
    * wallpaperfy needs a terminal always open in order to work. need to fix that.

need to make it more modular so it can have plugins to do other stuff. like having more than 1 image in the same
wallpaper
or having the image at the center have space from the border and drop a shadow. also have the background be dimmed
or any other plugin anyone can think off
