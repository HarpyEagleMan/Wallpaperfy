Running wallpaperfy
    * need someone to test it on macos as i dont have apple stuff
    * need someone to test in other desktop enviroment in linux. other than the one i tested. i3, i know
    diferent DE use diferent ways of setting wallpapers
    * also all other oses may need its way of setting wallpaper
    * wallpaperfy needs a terminal always open in order to work. need to fix that.

if this sofware gets going i am planning to add these features:
need to make it more modular so it can have plugins to do other stuff. like having more than 1 image in the same
wallpaper
or having the image at the center have space from the border and drop a shadow. also have the background be dimmed
or any other plugin anyone can think off
